# Embedded_Project_Laser_Tag
This project implements a interactive laser-tag system using ESP32 microcontrollers.

It processes IR signals, validates hits, manages gameplay logic, and updates scores in real time through a React-based web interface.


✨ Features

Real-time gameplay logic on ESP32

Signal-processing  for precise IR hit detection

Communication between modules using I2C, UART, and WebSocket

Wi-Fi connectivity for syncing hardware with the UI

React interface for live game monitoring and score tracking

Modular firmware architecture for easy extension and debugging
